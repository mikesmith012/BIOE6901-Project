PyQt5 Library by Riverbank
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PyQt5 is dual licensed on all platforms under the Riverbank Commercial License 
and the GPL v3. Your PyQt5 license must be compatible with your Qt license. If 
you use the GPL version then your own code must also use a compatible license.

PyQt5, unlike Qt, is not available under the LGPL.

Qt5 Library by The Qt Company
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Qt is available under different licensing options designed to accommodate the 
needs of our various users:

  * Qt licensed under commercial licenses is appropriate for development of 
    proprietary/commercial software where you do not want to share any source 
    code with third parties or otherwise cannot comply with the terms of the 
    GNU LGPL version 3.

  * Qt licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 3 is 
    appropriate for the development of Qt applications provided you can comply 
    with the terms and conditions of the GNU LGPL version 3 (or GNU GPL 
    version 3).

  * Qt components licensed under the Qt Marketplace License Agreement are 
    appropriate for the development of Qt applications commonly with Qt 
    software components licensed under the commercial or GNU LGPL version 3 (or 
    GNU GPL version 3) terms and conditions.

Qt contains also third-party code that is licensed under specific open-source 
licenses from the original authors.

Note: For open-source licensed Qt, some specific parts (modules) are not 
available under the GNU LGPL version 3, but under the GNU General Public 
License (GPL) instead. See the list of Qt modules for details. For commercial 
licensees, all modules are available under a single, commercial Qt license.
